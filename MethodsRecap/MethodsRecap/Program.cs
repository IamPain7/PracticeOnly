           1:Write a C# program that takes user input and creates a story.
            Ask the user for things like a name, color, an animal, etc. Make up a story and be creative.
            Hint:
            Use Console.ReadLine() to take user input and store the input into a variable.
            For example:  
            Ask the user “What is your name?”
            Store the input

            EXAMPLE:
                var name = Console.ReadLine();

            Record user input, for each of these. Combine all answers for a fun, short story. 
            Hint:

            Name: Michael
            Favorite Color: Blue
            Favorite Animal: Walrus
            Favorite Band: The Beatles
            Extra points - turn the answers into a fun short story!




            2:Write different methods that use each math operator, but allows you to plug in different integers. 
                Calling the different methods would look like: 
                Sum(2,4) would return 6
                Multiply(10,2) would return 20


                For Example:
   



                Challenge mode - using the params keyword:
                Change the functions to use the params keyword to support a range of arguments.
                Sum(2,4) would return 6
                Sum(2,4,6) would return 12.
                Sum(1,1,1,1,1) would return 5. 

                This way we could plug in multiple different values, and the method we write will still calculate it correctly, we could add, subtract, etc - as many values as we want
